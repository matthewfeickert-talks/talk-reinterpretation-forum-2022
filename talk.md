# Introduction and Overview

.kol-1-2.large[
- In Tuesday's session, Daniel Katz already gave very nice high level overview of software citation .bold[principles] and .bold[tools]
- This is an .red[opinionated] summary of the tooling landscape and examples of workflows
   - Full disclosure: Opinions formed from pyhf development and from Scikit-HEP community discussions (c.f. [Eduardo's talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1211229/contributions/5150204/)).
- Meant to be recommendations to software developers on making your work as .bold[easy to cite as possible]
   - These recommendations can transfer to experiment software as well

# Summary
.kol-2-3.huge[
- Build community practices on top of .bold[established standards]
   <!-- - There are professional communities at work building tools, so we should join them, not rebuild a wheel -->
- If citation of your software is important to you, .bold[make it easy] for a user to find your citation information
- Modern standards like `CITATION.cff` allow for .bold[single source of citation information] that can be exported as needed
- Long term archives + [FAIR practices](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1211229/contributions/5120857/)
   - Zenodo provides automatically release information each release

# Does any of this actually work?

As mentioned, these opinions have been formed from developing pyhf, and the citation count for the [JOSS paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02823) has increased each year.
